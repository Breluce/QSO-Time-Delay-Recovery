Algorithms to simulate quasar light curves based off of DRW/DHO/Power Law spectral density models in LCmodeling.py module. Modelingtest.py generates unresolved light curve models comprised of 2 individual images. Methods included in methods.py implement different techniques for recovering this time delay.
